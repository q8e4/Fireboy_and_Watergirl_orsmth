# Some kind of Platformer game

img are directory with game images stored in there,
other 2 files named 'lvl1.pkl' and 'lvl2.pkl' are gamelevels (in the code itself, there had to be no 2d arrays (they are game maps that are in pkl files))

fireboy_and_watergirl.py IS THE EXECUTABLE FILE 

In case if executable doesn't run try https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZX5kH72Yx4&list=LL&index=2&t=135s

If it still doesn't run, try installing the pygame libriary
